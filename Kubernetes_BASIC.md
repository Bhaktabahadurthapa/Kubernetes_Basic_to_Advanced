**Kubernetes Basics**

**ðŸ‘‰ What is Kubernetes?**
Overview of Kubernetes and why it's used in production environments
Understanding Kubernetes clusters, nodes, and pods
How Kubernetes fits into the DevOps lifecycle

**ðŸ‘‰ Kubernetes Architecture**
Master node, worker nodes, and control plane
Components: API server, controller manager, scheduler, kubelet, kube-proxy
Understanding Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, Services, Namespaces

**ðŸ‘‰ Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster**
Local Kubernetes with Minikube or Kind (Kubernetes IN Docker)
Setting up clusters in the cloud: EKS (AWS), GKE (Google Cloud), AKS (Azure)
Introduction to Kubernetes as a Service (KaaS)

**ðŸ‘‰ Basic Kubernetes Operations**
kubectl basics: commands, contexts, namespaces
Deploying applications using kubectl apply, kubectl get, kubectl describe
Scaling applications, rolling updates, and monitoring pod health


**Intermediate Kubernetes Concepts**

**ðŸ‘‰ Pods and Controllers**
Pod lifecycle: init containers, multi-container pods
ReplicaSets and Deployments for scaling applications
StatefulSets vs Deployments for stateful applications

**ðŸ‘‰ Services and Networking**
ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer services
Ingress controllers and setting up Ingress resources for HTTP(S) routing
DNS and Service Discovery in Kubernetes
Networking policies (e.g., Calico or Cilium)

**ðŸ‘‰  Storage in Kubernetes**
Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
Storage Classes, dynamic provisioning, and cloud storage integration (e.g., EBS, GCE persistent disks)
Stateful applications and database persistence

**ðŸ‘‰  Helm Package Manager**
Understanding Helm charts and their usage for deploying applications
Installing, upgrading, and managing Helm releases
Creating custom Helm charts for managing deployments

**Advanced Kubernetes**

**ðŸ‘‰  Kubernetes Security**
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and Service Accounts
Network policies for securing traffic between pods
Pod security policies, SecurityContext, and Seccomp profiles
Secrets management using Kubernetes Secrets or external solutions like HashiCorp Vault

**ðŸ‘‰ CI/CD Pipelines with Kubernetes**
Integration of Kubernetes with Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions
Automating deployments and scaling with Kubernetes
Continuous Delivery and GitOps concepts (e.g., ArgoCD, FluxCD)
Setting up automated rollback and monitoring

**ðŸ‘‰  Monitoring and Logging**
Metrics collection using Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager
Centralized logging using the EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) or Loki, Fluentbit, and Grafana
Setting up health checks and probes (liveness, readiness probes)
Logging practices with Kubernetes

**ðŸ‘‰ Autoscaling**
Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) based on CPU/Memory usage
Cluster Autoscaler for scaling nodes
Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)

**ðŸ‘‰  Kubernetes in Production**

ðŸ‘‰  Multi-Cluster Management
Managing multiple Kubernetes clusters (e.g., Federation, Rancher, etc.)
Handling deployments across different environments (prod, staging, dev)

ðŸ‘‰  Disaster Recovery and High Availability
Setting up high availability for master and worker nodes
Backup and restore strategies for persistent volumes and configurations
Ensuring cluster fault tolerance and resilience

ðŸ‘‰  Cost Optimization and Scaling
Cost management with Kubernetes in cloud environments
Optimizing resource requests and limits for pods
Understanding cloud pricing models (e.g., EC2, AKS, GKE) and optimizing Kubernetes clusters for efficiency
