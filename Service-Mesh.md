## A service mesh is essentially an infrastructure layer that manages how different microservices in Kubernetes communicate with each other. Think of it as a dedicated network layer that handles security, monitoring, and traffic control between services, making complex applications easier to manage and more reliable.

## KEY NOTES: 
```
Basic Components
1. Sidecar Proxy: A helper container that sits next to each service
2. Control Plane: Central management system for all proxies
3. Data Plane: Network of proxies handling actual traffic
