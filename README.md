# Kubernetes_Basic_to_Advanced


## Prerequisite Knowledge

## Operating System & Linux Fundamentals
âœ… **Linux Basics**
File system, permissions, and process management
Networking concepts like IP, DNS, Ports
Package management (e.g., apt, yum, dnf)
Command-line proficiency
File system navigation
Process management
System configuration
Shell scripting (Bash/Zsh)
Package management
System monitoring

âœ… Key Linux Commands
ls, cd, pwd
grep, sed, awk
systemctl
top, ps
chmod, chown
network configuration
tar, zip operations

âœ… More Details:

File System and Permissions:
Basic file operations: ls, cd, cp, mv, rm

File and directory permissions: chmod, chown, ls -l
Understanding the Linux file system structure (/etc, /var, /home, /usr, etc.)

Processes:
Viewing running processes with ps, top, htop
Process management: kill, killall, bg, fg, jobs

Package Management:
Installing packages using package managers like apt (Ubuntu/Debian), yum (CentOS/RHEL), dnf (Fedora)
Understanding package installation, updates, and removals

## Basic Networking Concepts

Kubernetes relies heavily on networking, and understanding key networking concepts is crucial to managing clusters effectively.

âœ…TCP/IP Networking:
The basics of the OSI and TCP/IP models, layers of networking, and how data is transmitted across networks

âœ…DNS (Domain Name System):
How DNS works, how it resolves domain names to IP addresses, and its role in service discovery

âœ…IP Addresses and Subnets:
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, subnet masks, CIDR notation, and how they are used in networking

âœ…Ports and Firewalls:
How ports are used to establish network connections, understanding common ports for HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, etc.
Firewall management, using ufw or iptables to manage network traffic

âœ…Routing and Load Balancing:
Basic understanding of routing protocols and how load balancing works across multiple nodes (round-robin, least connections, etc.)

TCP/IP stack, DNS, Load Balancing, Proxying
Ports, subnets, and network isolation
Understanding NAT, IP address allocation, and DNS resolution in a containerized environment

âœ… **Networking:**
Basic networking commands: ping, netstat, ifconfig, ip a, curl
Understanding IP addresses, subnetting, and routing basics

âœ… **Logs and Monitoring**:
Viewing system logs using journalctl, tail -f /var/log/syslog
Basic log management and monitoring of system health

**More Topics:**

âœ… Networking Concepts

**Network Fundamentals**
```--- OSI Model layers
--- TCP/IP protocol suite
--- IP addressing
--- Subnetting
--- Network routing
--- DNS resolution
--- Port forwarding
--- Load balancing principles```

âœ… **Advanced Networking**
```
--- Network namespaces
--- Virtual networking
--- Container networking models
--- Service discovery
--- Ingress/Egress traffic
--- Network policies
```

## Containerization (Docker)

âœ…  What containers are and how they differ from virtual machines
âœ…  How Docker works: images, containers, Dockerfile, volumes, and networks
âœ…  Managing Docker containers: docker run, docker ps, docker exec, docker logs
âœ…  Creating Docker images, writing Dockerfiles
Containers are the foundation of Kubernetes. If you're new to containers, understanding Docker is critical.
